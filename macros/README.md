This crate is simply used for [StrawberryVM](https://crates.io/crates/strawberryvm).

It implements these macros:
- `FromU8` for automatically implementing from u8 traits
- `VmInstruction` for creating encode functions, implementing traits, etc.

It is not intended to be used outside of the [StrawberryVM](https://crates.io/crates/strawberryvm) project but if you find a use for it somehow, go ahead! It's licensed under MIT.
